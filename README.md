# Team Best Practices:
- only commit working code!!
- fix code before writing new code
- commit often(you can break your task into working chunks)
- merge branches into master every sprint
- write documentation(good comments and good commit messages)
- don't leave commented out code(if we don't need it, delete it)

# Helpful Git Flow and Commands
1. Copy to your local environment 
```
    git clone copied-link
```
2. Switch to  correct branch
```
    To check: git branch
    To switch: git checkout branch-name
```

When you're done coding

3. Add files for commit
```
    All files changed: git add .  or git add -A
    Specific files: git add file_name
```
4. Commit changes
```
    git commit -m "a really good commit message about what you did"
```
5. Pull
```
    git pull
```
6. If there aren't any merge issues, push
```
    git push
```

You can check the files you're adding to staging and their status with 
```
    git status
```
